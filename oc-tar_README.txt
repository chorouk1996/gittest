The binary file "oc.tar" is too big to be added in gitLab.
Nevertheless, here is the procedure to get it from RHOCP : 

RHOCP > "?" button on menu bar on top > "Command Line Tools" > "oc CLI" section

NOTE : In order to minimize size of the final docker image, it is preferable to untar first the "oc.tar" file, before running the "docker build" command.
